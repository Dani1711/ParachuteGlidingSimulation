Parachute Gliding Simulation
This project simulates the gliding of a parachute in a browser environment using JavaScript. It creates a simple animation where a blue circle (representing the parachute) falls and rebounds with a bouncing effect.

How It Works
The simulation is implemented using JavaScript. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

Parachute Object: The parachute is represented as an object with properties such as height, velocity, acceleration, and gravity.
Deployment: Initially, the parachute is deployed at a height of 0 with zero velocity.
Update Function: There is an update function that is called repeatedly using requestAnimationFrame(). This function updates the height and velocity of the parachute based on acceleration and gravity.
Rendering: Another function is responsible for rendering the parachute on the screen. It updates the position of the parachute element based on its current height.
Usage
To use this simulation, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. You will see the parachute falling and bouncing on the screen.
